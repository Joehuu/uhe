A personal Rainmeter suite.

This was made solely for me and not for others in mind, so YMMV.

This project started in July 2019 and has steadily gone through many revisions but is still very WIP. The commit history was reset to not worry and waste time looking if there was something sensitive. It is public now, so I can be more cautious about what to commit.

*Note: This suite contains [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)-related skins out of the box.*
